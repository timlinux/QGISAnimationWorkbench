# Frequently Asked Questions

#### Can I add any image to the intro or outro?

- As long as you can provide the proper attribution for an image you can use it in your project.

#### I have an older, less powerful, computer, will it handle running this workbench?

- If you open the standard QGIS settings dialog and select the Animation Workbench options
you can follow the advice with regards to lowering the number of threads allowed during
rendering to help you computer cope. Rendering shorter movies or GIFs (i.e. fewer frames)
will also help. Below is an example of running a job with 9000 frames at 60fps and 999
frames per feature
